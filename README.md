deKernel
========

## A simple Command Line Tool to help with removing old/unused kernels.
*(Especially when they have built up over time and are waisting disk space.)*

#### Instructions
1. `git clone git@github.com:snarlysodboxer/deKernel.git`
2. `cd deKernel`
3. `./deKernelScript`
4. Follow the directions! It will confirm with you before making any changes.

#### NOTES
* This script has currently only been tested on Ubuntu systems. I welcome pull requests to make it compatible with other releases.
