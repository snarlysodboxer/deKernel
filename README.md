deKernel
========

## A simple library to help with removing old/unused kernels.
*(Especially when they have built up over time and are waisting disk space.)*

#### Instructions
Simply run `sudo ruby deKernelScript`

#### NOTES:
This script has currently only been tested on Ubuntu systems. I welcome pull requests to make it compatible with other releases.
